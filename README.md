Spotify -> Tidal playlist transfer fullstack application (still in development) 

Fullâ€‘stack example app (.NET backend + Vite + React + TypeScript frontend) demonstrating OAuth 2.0 (PKCE) flows. The main purpose of this application is for learning purposeses.
As such from this project I hope to better understand:

- Exception handling
- Authenthication flows
- Work with APIs
- Fullstack application development
- Tanstack router
